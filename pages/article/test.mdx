## Blockquotes

> Both elbows on the table, I covered my face with my palms.
>
> Inside that darkness, I saw rain falling on the sea. Rain softly falling on a vast sea, with no one there to see it. The rain strikes the surface of the sea, yet even the fish donâ€™t know it is raining.
>
> Until someone came and lightly rested a hand on my shoulder, my thoughts were of the sea.
-- Haruki Murakami, South of the Border, West of the Sun
