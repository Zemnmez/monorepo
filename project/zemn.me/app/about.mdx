The design of this website.
---------------------------

This website is a direct descendant of one I made in 2019.
The core ideas come from very early on when I
was using the internet, and I didn't want to tell
people with my chosen username what kind of person I
was. I picked the username 'zemnmez' to
be something meaningless that people could fill with
their own ideas of who I was.

Similarly, when I made the website, I didn't want to
tell people directly about myself, so instead I made
this timeline to keep track of what I had done every
year. The number in roman numerals is my age that
year. It fulfilled another role as I was collecting
my work to apply for my US O1 visa, which requires
proving that you've done a lot of interesting
things!

The background video ('hero video') in summer is of a hidden area in
the gardens of [Kenwood House], a beautiful stately home sandwiched between
Highgate and Hampstead in London where I grew up.  It's located at about
[51.57139601074658°N, -0.16924392259112794°E].

It used to be that there was a bench hidden under
overgrown bushes and a tree near the hydrangeas past
the orangery. I took a video from there one summer –
I was collecting photos and videos to remind me of
home because I knew I'd leave it behind someday to
move to the US.

The type and style itself was inspired by older,
pre-computer era typsetting such as the [Lloyd's Act 1871].

Particular effort was put into trying to have
content fill horizontal space automatically, as seen
in older documents that try to make the most of the
paper they're printed on.

What's the difference between <ZemnmezLogoInline /> and <TimeEyeInline />?
---------------------------------------------------

The diamond logo (<ZemnmezLogoInline />) came out of
several years of wanting a way to express myself in
art. For a few years following, I changed logo
annually based how I'd felt the year prior, making
logos with geometry and construction lines.

When I eventually made the diamond logo, it ended up
looking a like an eye logo I'd made very early on in
2012. I liked it so much it came to represent the
persona I had since 2009. The logo itself is from
much later, probably around 2015.

The time eye logo (<TimeEyeInline />) was the later
(2019) creation, coming out of a specific need to
disambiguate between the published work I had as
'Thomas Shadwell', my real name, versus
'zemnmez', the persona I had used since
2009. It became necessary after I made the Forbes
Under 30 list for my tax system hack in 2018. Before
this point I'd worked hard to try to keep the two
identities separate, but Forbes lists aren't really
for online personas.

The eye logo is a reference to the well-known '[eye of providence]', a symbol that represents human achievement as
being incomplete without God. I wanted it to reflect
the idea that, in a universe that might not have a
God, we as people have a responsibility to care for
each other.

In having to make this distinction, for a short time
the work published as 'zemnmez'
continued to represent the things I was most proud
of – an idealised kind of self. But at Google, I
started to publish security research I was really
proud of as both 'zemnmez' and
'Thomas Shadwell' The abstract ideas are
still there, but now I'm more 'Thomas'
than I ever was. ☺
