# Kenwood

This video has been on my website for a good five years.

I grew up between Hampstead and Highgate in north London, UK until I was 7 years old, and my mother would take me to the local manor, Kenwood House every single day for breakfast.

When I got my first full-time job, I moved back to Highgate. I'd dream about it for years after I moved away, unsure if it was real.

The summers in Kenwood are beautiful. I spent a lot of time taking pictures around the places I grew up, knowing that one day I would be moving to the US to continue my technology career.

If you walk away from the Kenwood orangery East, cutting across the lawn to the marked trail this coordinate is on, there used to be some small stepping stones far overgrown. I wondered what those were once, and found myself under a huge old tree covering a bench that had at some point been forgotten.

This video is of the light shining through the leaves of that big old tree.

I think a year or two before I left Highgate, the tree was cut back.
