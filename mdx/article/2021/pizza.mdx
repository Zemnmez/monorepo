# Thomas' Pizza Recipe

This is an extended version of [Brian's Pizza Recipe], which, because I'm a dumbass I fucked up a few times; with some amendments also from [my brother] who linked it to me. It also specifically describes the toppings I like. It uses wet mozzerella, which is a little trickier but makes everything tastier, moister and chewier

### Tools

-   Stand mixer †
-   Pizza Peel
-   Ladle or Spoon
-   [Pizza Stone]
-   Large Sandwich Bags and / or Clingfilm
-   2 Bowls
-   Sharp Knife
-   Cup measures / teaspoon measures
-   Towel (optional)
-   Aluminium pizza pan (optional)
-   Dough cutter (optional)

You can probably do without the pizza pan, but it's useful for shaping the pizza. The stand mixer is also not mandatory but it's a lot more work without it, and your consistency won't be as good!

## Method

Ingredients in **bold type**, timings in _italic type_.

### Making the Dough

_About 20 mins of work._

1.  In a bowl add **¼ cup Warm water**, **¼ teaspoon Active dry yeast** and **½ teaspoon Granulated sugar**. Dissolve them together thoroughly, mixing with a fork.

2.  In the bowl of the standing mixer, add **½ cup Cool water**, **1 teaspoon of salt** and the **water**, **yeast** and **sugar** mixture. If you’re using some MSG, chuck a bit in there too to give the dough a more full-bodied flavour.

3.  With the mixer on slow with the paddle blade, add **about ⅓ (83g) of the flour**.

4.  Mix at increasing speed for at least a minute until it forms a smooth batter or runny custard like consistency. If the mixture doesn’t thicken up to that consistency, just add a bit more flour.

5.  On a slow speed, add, bit by bit, add the **remaining flour**.

6.  Once the mixture starts to gather into a dough, stop the mixer and cut the nascent dough off the paddle blade with a sharp knife. Swap out for the dough hook and run on medium speed for _8–10 minutes_.

7.  Lightly oil a bowl with **Extra Virgin Olive Oil**. Transfer the dough into the bow, and cover it with clingfilm or a large sandwich bag. Put in a warm place for _1 hour 30 mins_.

8.  Remove the dough from the bowl, and cut in two with a dough cutter, or large knife. Put the ball of dough in its own sandwich bad, or wrap in clingfilm. It should be air tight!

9.  Place in the fridge, potentially wrapped with a towel in case it freezes for _24 hours_. Can do 12 hours instead (I did this by accident a few times) and it's nearly the same. You can keep it in the fridge for a good long while until you feel like pizza

## Cooking the Pizza

_About 10 mins of work_

1.  \*_One and a half hours_ before making pizza, remove the dough (as many balls as you want pizzas) from the fridge and put the oven on its highest possible temperature with the pizza stone on a shelf in the middle. Remove any wire shelves that might be above it, they'll make it harder!

2.  Lightly flour a pizza pan, dish, or plate. Don't get too conservative with the flour though!

3.  Hold the dough between your thumb and forefinger and let its weight stretch it out. As it does so, move your hands along the dough to try to stretch it into a rough circle, changing your grip to hold and thus stretch the thicker parts of the dough. Ah, fuck, it doesn't look like a circle that much. Don't worry about it.

4.  Put the dough into the pan, dish, or plate. Using your thumb and forefinger again, try to stretch out the thicker bits of the dough so that it naturally covers the plate. Be aware of the dough sticking, and if it sticks to the dish, sneak some flour under there. You'll know if you have more thanm enough if the dough no longer picks up the flour from under it.

5.  This is your last reasonable chance to make sure the pizza isn't sticking to the dish. Pick up the dish and tip it about a 20° angle. It should slip all in one go. If it doesn't, put more flour under it.

6.  Using a ladle or spoon, put a bit of **Pizza sauce** on the pizza. Then, using the back of the spoon or ladle, spread it so it's a thin layer. Repeat until there's a thin layer over the whole pizza. Careful around the edges -- you don't want any sauce running off and burning in the oven.

7.  Roughly tear some of the **Parma Ham** and put it on top of the sauce.

8.  Take some **Olives** from the jar (it kinda sucks, but with a fork) and put them on top of the pizza. Try not to let too much brine get on the dough as this will make it stick. It tastes great so don't worry too much about it either!

9.  The dough should be topped, and it should be possible to slide the dough off the plate / pizza pan without it sticking. You have been warned!

10. Lightly flour the pizza peel and slide the pizza onto it.

11. This needs to be done quickly, so that the mozzerella doesn't soak into the dough too much and make it stick to the peel: roughly tear some medium sized chunks off the **mozzerella**, about the size of a plum tomato, and put it on top of the pizza.

12. You are still working against the clock here! Pick up the pizza on the peel and open the oven. You’re aiming to put the pizza right in the middle of the stone, without too much heat loss from the oven. Put the bottom edge of the peel around the bottom edge of the pizza stone, and tip it so the pizza slides onto the stone. As you do, withdraw the peel. Close the oven.

13. Relax! Let the pizza cook on the stone. It should be a bit crispy, but clearly still soft. You’ll see the ham crisping up due to the [Malliard Reaction], a highly technical chemical process that makes food taste fucking great.

14. Slide the peel under the pizza. If it’s done, it’ll slide off easily. If it doesn’t, you fucked up. Put it on a plate.

15. Take a little bit of Extra **Virgin Olive Oil** in your hands, and rub it into the **Arugula / Rocket**. This adds to the flavour, and stops it tasting a bit dry. Put it on the pizza.

16. Add pepper to taste and serve!!

## Pitfalls

-   Don’t try to add a crust to the pizza by leaving lots of thick dough. You can try it, but you will end up with a fucking huge crust. It’ll look like a volcanic lagoon.

-   If you want to add more water, be careful! It’s very easy to make it too sticky.

-   When adding the rest of the flour, make sure not to run the paddle on fast. You’ll end up with a weird dough.
