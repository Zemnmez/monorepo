    "'It is inconceivable that, in ordinary circumstances, my right honourable friend the |Secretary of State or any of his successors -- or for that matter, predecessors -- would authorise the use of lethal force. No force likely to cause injury, far less lethal force,could be used and be lawful unless it was authorised, because of the impact of the 1948 Act. the only lawful force that could be used abroad is that authorised through an authorisation issued by the Secretary of State.' [...] 'I do not want to exclude the ability to do so in those circumstances, but I can say that assassination is no part of the policy of Her Majesty's Government.' "
