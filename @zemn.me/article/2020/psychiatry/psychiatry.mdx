# Therapy, Psychiatry, Medication, Mental Health, and Me

This story is, in essence, the story of my whole life. Every time I try to tell it I veer off into describing all the minutae that make up my experience -- but those aren't the important parts. This is what I learned about finding a better me.

Most of this article will be experience and opinion. I think I could spend more time justifying some of these ideas, but the important thing I feel is just to get my experience out there, as odd as that sounds.

## Part 1: Therapy

Therapy is the first stop everyone who thinks they might be experiencing brain problems goes through. Like many things around mental health, it's inexact, not always quite a science, and also not always terribly effective.

Most annoyingly, a therapist, despite usually being your first port of call is not technically someone who is professionally well-versed in mental health conditions, but someone who has trained to deliver 'psychotherapy', which is a branch of psychology.

Look, maybe everyone who is reading this article already knows this distinction, but there is a *colossal* gulf between what 'psychology' and 'psychiatry' is.

Now: before I get to deep into this, I am not by any means an unrelenting proponent of psychiatry (I'll get to that later) -- but, psychology is not a medical science. A psychologist may be, but is not usually a doctor. Instead, psychology is the study of very 'high-level' phenomena in the brain. Psychology is the study of 'conscious' and 'unconscious' phenomena, and understanding what shapes people's 'psyche' -- their *self*.

A therapist will ask you questions and attempt to probe what makes you tick. What they ask about just depends on their job title. A 'family therapist' will ask you mostly about your relationship with your parents, for example. Generic therapists will listen about your life and ask 'why do you feel that way'.

This kind of treatment has its place, but it's important to understand somewhat that it's geared toward treating 'neurotypical' people, i.e. treating people without a chronic mental health condition, diagnosed or otherwise. And the system under which mental health is understood is ... psychology isn't fake, but it represents a somewhat more philosophy-focused approach to mental health, and of its understandings of the psyche are based on more contrivances than one might be comfortable with.^[1]

I see the place of psychotherapy in mental health as 'being able to clear some mental baggage'. Don't expect the therapist to give you some revalation about the way your life works, or has worked. Modern day life is a hard thing to deal with for a monkey brain, and we tend to have things we never get past emotionally, like a notification you just can't dismiss. Psychotherapy gives you a chance to face your discomforts, and, in doing so dismiss them.

The trap here is that psychotherapists, except the very good ones will see most issues you experience as something that is best treated with psychotherapy; and if you were, say -- actually suffering chronic depression, or ADHD, or OCD there's a fair chance you might get stuck in the psychotherapy system forever, getting small wins where you want real answers.

Personally, when I first got diagnosed with depression (a somewhat improper diagnosis as we'll discover) the first thing that was made available to me was psychotherapy. And, in honesty it helped. I feel like I got past a lot of stuff. A lot of the more acute symptoms though, persisted.

One last note on psychology and psychotherapy: you may have heard of Cognitive Behavioral Theraphy. CBT is an interesting one, it's a somewhat more scientific way of deploying psychotherapy, and focuses directly on treating symptoms. It's well tested on a number of psychiatric (i.e. mental health) conditions, and generally it works a little bit, not usually as much as medication, but both can be done to good effect.

## Part 2: Psychiatry

Psychiatry is the 'real' medical field of treating mental health problems. Psychiatrists can diagnose you, and they can deploy some of the most effective, tested treatments to help you. But if only it were as simple as that.

It's difficult to synthesise exactly why psychiatry is such a tricky field, but it's somewhere between that the doctors themselves usually have not experienced the (1) condition that they're trying to treat (2) medication that they're using to treat it, and often (3) -- our understanding of the concrete biological reason for most mental health conditions is incomplete.

Whenever I talk to friends about their being non-neurotypical in some way, for example dealing with depression, anxiety, ADHD or something else I always say the most important thing is getting a diagnosis, so you can start giving yourself real, useful mental boundaries based on an understanding of where you might have issue.

For example, once I knew I had depression, I started to be able to recognise it once I knew the experience was not the normal kind of sadness that people relate to you. Once you know that, you can separate it out and deal with it differently. With sadness, you might search for a reason. With depression, you can give yourself space, and time, and let yourself let those feelings go. It's like suddenly having a word for the colour between green and blue.

### Psychiatry: On Diagnosis

To bring the point back, the second most important I tell friends to do is to look for an over-arching condition. This is the problem with psychiatry, in my opinion: psychiatrists are often primed to see conditions they already know, understand or diagnose a lot of -- which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as most mental health conditions have a lot of overlap with others.

For example, two different people with ADHD and autism respectively -- two conditions more different than they are similar -- can both run the gauntlet of tests with a psychiatrist and both leave diagnosed with *only* chronic depression and / or anxiety disorder, because both of these conditions have these highly-cormorbid (common) side-effects.

The deleterous effects of this reductionism is that the treatments of anxiety and depression are distinct, for the most part from autism ADHD, but provide some small benefit.

It pains me to think of the sadly large number of friends I have who have spent much of their adult lives going through 17 different kinds of antidepressants that all provide some mediocre benfit as they continue to live their lives in difficulty. In the case of ADHD, some end up taking an antidepressant that also has stimulant effect and / or becoming dependant on energy drinks, for which their psychitrist *or psychiatrists* has or have no explanation, despite what's on the cards.

This is the tricky thing. People with access to no mental health resources must overcome an enormous barrier to actually see a professional, and they're often likely to be partially, or wholly misdiagnosed. Those who are often wealthier or just have access to better mental health resources, through friends or otherwise are more likey to know what they think they might have -- and see a specialist in that area.

To say the least, this is kind of fucked up. One can go to a psychiatrist with autism and spend the rest of their life nursing depression, simply because only the more specialised psychiatrists can recognise it -- or even, especially in the US, *believe* in that condition at all in the case of ADHD.

Consider my experience:

1. I had trouble in school from the youngest age. I had severe trouble concentrating in class, which manifested as having very poor writing skills and not giving in homework. I'm predisposed to bouts of extreme focus.
2. At the age of 8, my parents took me to a child psychologist (nb: psychologist). They thought it might be dylexia (the condition of having trouble reading, and sometimes writing)
3. I saw a dyslexia specialist, who, after running the dylexia tests determined I either had very atypical dyslexia or no dyslexia at all
4. I continued to suffer, and struggled with crippling levels of insomnia, anxiety, and depression -- though I didn't have any words for these
5. After failing to get into any university to study medicine, I dropped out of the education system and thought I might have depression
6. At the age of about 18, I see a GP, who diagnoses me with mild depression and sends me off for therapy
7. I luckily have a lifeline and start a successful career in the technology industry
8. The symptoms I associate with depression often become crippling, and I'm totally taken out of service for about 3 months
9. My girlfriend thinks I might have ADHD. I see an ADHD specialist and am immediately diagnosed with ADHD -- 'a more than textbook case'
10. I've been taking medication for ADHD ever since, and I've lived better than I ever have in the years prior

This is multiple mis-, or partial diagnoses over the course of more than two decades, and ultimately my best diagnosis came from *my girlfriend*. Everyone who assessed me believed they had whatever condition they were primed to assess me for whether that's *dyslexia*, *depression*, or ADHD; and due to the structure of the medical system, only a specialist could really diagnose me with my condition -- a specialist I was not likely to be referred to.

This is the unfortunate cognitive dissonance of recommending friends see psychiatrists: in part, what kind of psyhchiatrist I recommend a friend see is going to affect their potential diagnosis.

### Psychiatry: On Medication

Some of the best treatments we have for psychiatric conditions are medications.
