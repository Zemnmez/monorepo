# Cyberpunk 2077: A Masterpiece in Ruins

The first thing about Cyberpunk 2077 that outsiders to the games industry must understand is who the developers, CD Projekt Red are.

CD Projekt Red is a Polish games developer who are pretty exclusively famous for their *Witcher* series, a series of role-playing games based on the Polish fantasy novel series *Wied≈∫min* by Andrzej Sapkowski. These games are, without exeception, critically acclaimed. The most recent of the Witcher series, Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is considered one of the best games of all time.

Two years prior to the release of Witcher 3, CD Projekt Red released a teaser trailer for a game with a completely new setting, totally different from Witcher. The game would be called *Cyberpunk 2077* and be set in a futuristic dystopia. It was understandable, then that expectations were extremely high for Cyberpunk.

While there have been several game series set in the Cyberpunk genre as a whole -- perhaps most notably, the Deus Ex franchise -- none really attempted the open-world RPG style Cyberpunk 2077 was going for. CDPR brought on one *Mike Pondsmith*, who developed the Cyberpunk tabletop role-playing game franchise to advise on the development of this future game. Notably, the second edition of the Cyberpunk TTRPG was called *Cyberpunk 2020*, which is an interesting coincidence considering the 2020 real world release date of Cyberpunk 2077.

Fans expected a certian kind of gameplay, considering the type of game that CDPR usually produces: beautiful, open-ended games with deep story character interaction, and simple but engaging combat mechanics. Most games, you see, you kind of either win, or lose -- but some games, like Witcher, and in a similar novel adaptation vein, *Metro* allow for more complex game outcomes based on sometimes even subtle actions taken by the player.

### A CDPR Case Study: The Whispering Hillock

In Witcher 3, baron named Phillip Strenger, who has established himself as the lord of the local barony whose *de jure* holder fled the province as it became the battleground for warring kingdoms.

Philip is a respected soldier and a deeply troubled man. He fought to defend his homeland, but the war was lost and he became dependent on drink to deal with the trauma. Geralt, the player character visits the baron's stronghold as part of the overarching series of main quests.

Even from before the quest begins, the gameplay changes depending on the player's actions. Previously, the player met the baron's men in an inn, wherein they become rowdy and -- for lack of a more convenient term -- pretty racist. If the player kills the men in the brawl, the player has a much harder time convincing the guards he should be let into the fort.

The baron, found in a beautiful flower garden and visibly distraught asks the player to find his wife and daughter, who have mysteriously disappeared and, despite his considerable efforts, evaded location.

In searching for clues, the player discovers that the baron, in a drink-fueled fit of rage attacked his wife and caused a miscarriage, after which she fled. The event was so traumatic that a malicious, foetal spirit -- a botchling -- had come to haunt the baron, and it would eventually kill his wife. The baron had known this all along, and was trying to cover up his guilt by acting as if they had vanished.

The player is led by the baron to the location of the botchling and gets to decide what happens next. Either they slay it and break the curse by force, or they can convince the father to cradle the spirit, name it, and bury it under the threshold of his home, accepting it and turning it into a guardian spirit.

Either way, the location of the spirit's mother is revealed to the player and the player eventually finds her enthralled in the service of powerful and dangerous witches. Here, they can inform Philip of the location of his wife, and he gathers his men to assist you in fighting the witches for her life.

But the curse on the mother is strong. Here, the quest splits into three different endings depending on the player's actions.

(1) An ancient and malevolent spirit called 'The Whispering Hillock', which is trapped by the witches can cut a deal with the player to defeat the witches. This destroys an impoverished nearby village that worshipped them as gods, and kills the orphans the witches have enthralled. It saves the mother, however -- but in a cursed form. The baron vows to save her and spends the prologue searching for a cure to her curse, leaving his sergeant to tend to the barony. The sergeant is a piece of shit, but the baron eventually returns remorseful and vows to reform his ways, and make better of the province.

If the player does not cut a deal with the spirit, the player needs to remove from the witches custody a doll that holds power over the mother as a representation of her spirit. There are several dolls, and to pick the right one, the player must remember an anecdote by the baron -- that, when they took the fort, he built her a garden of her favourite flowers -- hollyhock blossoms -- at great expense. That is where he was found crying at the start of the quest.

(2) If the player chooses wrong, the mother bursts into flames and dies. The baron, wracked with guilt and grief takes his own life and the province becomes even more lawless and deprived as the baron's men fight over power.

(3) If the player chooses right, the mother is returned to her normal self, but will soon die as her life is tied to the curse. Philip apologises but ultimately hangs himself as his wife passes away, and the province again descends into chaos. 

With either of those last two choices, the local village survives, but is left to fend for what little it has left without the witches unholy influence. The orphans *do* escape this time, and manage to eke out a somewhat normal life with their previously enthralled caretaker.
