When I dream, I barely dream at all, as far as I can tell. Though I can assure you I've slept most days these 26 years I cannot recall ever having seen a face, or touching a hand in one.

As a kid, I had recurring nightmares set in one long, complicated imaginary world. I slept with the light on until I was 14 years old.

But when awake, though I never daydream, I see beautiful things in my mind's eye. Still, never people, sure. I find those very hard to imagine. But I see blue skies framed in thick, summer-warmed glass of an old glasshouse, and I can breathe the thick air coming off the plants.

It's a strange thing to know you're alive. It's good, I know. It is, in a self-fulfilling way, kind of the best thing. There isn't really a logic to be found that could value the alternative.

Have you ever thought what it means to be, in a way, an agent? 'I think therefore I am' has some truth to it, but it doesn't really express the real weight of knowing that you percieve. That's a kind of hard thing to explain but -- think about this: there isn't a system you've ever learned of that explains why you decide what you do, why you sit in your brain and do the day-to-day.

Imagine an abacus. It's a wooden thing with a bunch of beads on it, and if I can throw out a totally spurious history fact, one of the oldest calculating machines ever made. Now, I can write a progam that can do these calculations easily, and faster too. It looks like the brain is probably a kind of machine, like a really good abacus. You probably know that one.

But I never pick up an abacus and wonder if there is a *thing* in there, perceiving with whatever it has. It has no feelings, sure. Only things with a brain have feelings. If I can't see without eyes, how could an abacus be a sentient observer with nothing?

So where does it start? What is it that made my camera start rolling those 26 years ago? I can't seem to ever really prove that others also inhabit a time, filling it with decisions the way I do, but they really do act like it, right?

As a kid you imagine ghosts, and you just fear ideas. Just outlines of the shapes of things in your head. But there's something to that in a way. Sure, the everyday keeps on being the everyday, but I don't have a clue why it does.

In a way, those abstract ideas are far more tangible than anything 'reality' will ever throw at you. Oh, and you know I don't mean that in a silly way. It's just that, an imagined thing is an imagined thing -- nothing more, nothing less. Nobody asks of an imagined thing whether it could be real, at least not seriously.

I evolved right? Or my ancestors did, over millennia. And I think that's the thing about spontaneous order: you can't ask questions of it. If an abacus doesn't have its little camera inside it, percieving in some way an abacus can, then it seems there must be some extra thing, some complex kind of mechanism that pulled my camera out of the ether.

I think about that every now and then. A kind of 'sentience harness' that adds a certian, unquantifiable agency to an entity. But if we evolved that, why? Machines really seem to be able to do anything.

It seems that whatever it is, it is subtle and hidden. But that's the advantage game a blind gambler can play: they can't see the board. They can't see the pieces. But they can keep rolling forever, reaching out into the little cracks in the seams of their game they've played for so long.

It's such a long time. Think of one of those AI algorithms that learns by just trying dumb shit really rapidly (all of them really). Like, say, GPT-3. I can't find out how much CPU (GPU) time GPT-3 used, but I think, since GPT-2 came out in about 2019, it doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that its language model, which is uncanny, but almost, not quite human; it doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that its language model has been being trained since 2019.

That's three years. In that time, it's apparently gone through 3.2 million iterations. And that sounds pretty huge, but humans broke off from apes 10 million years ago. GPT-3, our scariest seeming AI could have been trained doing one operation every *ten years* just over the course of human *differentiation*, not evolution. Mammals apparently started showing up about 235 million years ago. It really astounds me that humans have managed to do things that nature hasn't managed to do by accident in that time.

That's the thing really. Who knows if the solution here is even *knowable*? That's the kind of question that starts blunting your tools and running around being a dipshit, though.
