Colma
-----

When you move to a new place, you get this deep fascination for 'why?'. All these things
you didn't know could be different are, and you realise you understood the world less
than you thought.

So I Googled why the supermarkets from back in the UK aren't here, and they all failed in various
ways that are summarised as 'misunderstanding what the American consumer wants'.

It sounded dumb when I read it. Everyone knows that you can't make a grocery store you have to
drive to every day for fresh food in the US, right?

But looking out at Colma, the 8 lane roads and colossal, wonderous shops -- surrounded by
ancient Californian idyll I realised that *I* didn't actually understand how this all
works either. Their guesss is as good as mine.
