svgshot
=============================================================================
[svgshot]: #svgshot

Svgshot takes 'screenshots' of webpages as minimised SVGs. This makes them
great for rendering in videos or webpages.


Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Example]: #example


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      bash
svgshot https://en.wikipedia.org
# loading https://en.wikipedia.org
# writing Wikipedia__the_free_encyclopedia.svg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Wikipedia SVG]: ./docs/Wikipedia__the_free_encyclopedia.svg
![Wikipedia SVG]

With `--block` for removing text¹:

[Twitch SVG]: ./docs/Twitch.svg
![Twitch SVG]

[Examples directory]: ./examples
For more examples, take a look at the [Examples directory].

[BLOKK font]: http://www.blokkfont.com/

¹ Orginally this was intended to block out text like the [BLOKK font], but
I couldn't do this without creating truly huge SVGs. If you have any ideas
as to how this could be achieved, let me know!

Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Installation]: #Installation

With node and `inkscape` installed:
```bash
npm install -g svgshot
```

If you don't have `inkscape` installed on windows, try `scoop`:
```powershell
scoop install inkscape
```

For temporary usage you might want to use `npx`:
```bash
npx svgshot https://en.wikipedia.org
```

TODO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Replace SVG dimensions with viewBox so they dont get weirdly warped when
rendered at the wrong size:
