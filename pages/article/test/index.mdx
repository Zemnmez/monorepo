# Test

## Head component

<head>a</head>

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

* section 1
* section 2
  * section 2.1
  * section 2.2
* section 2.3

### Ordered Lists

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
   1. This item is very long. There are a lot of words here, so the item may go across multiple lines. This hopefully demonstrates that usefully.
   1. Item 3c

### Mixed Lists

* Section 1
  1. Section 1.1
* Section 2
  1. Section 2.1

### Lists with Paragraphs

1. 
  Growing up in the suburbs in post-war Japan, it seemed to Hajime that everyone but him had brothers and sisters. His sole companion was Shimamoto, also an only child. Together they spent long afternoons listening to her father's record collection.

  But when his family moved away, the two lost touch. Now Hajime is in his thirties. After a decade of drifting he has found happiness with his loving wife and two daughters, and success running a jazz bar. Then Shimamoto reappears. She is beautiful, intense, enveloped in mystery. Hajime is catapulted into the past, putting at risk all he has in the present.

### Lists With Space
1. This is a list item, which is really long, so I add a line at the end to make it more readable. MDX interprets that as a paragraph.

2. This is a second item

## Blockquotes

> Both elbows on the table, I covered my face with my palms.
>
> Inside that darkness, I saw rain falling on the sea. Rain softly falling on a vast sea, with no one there to see it. The rain strikes the surface of the sea, yet even the fish don’t know it is raining.
>
> Until someone came and lightly rested a hand on my shoulder, my thoughts were of the sea.
-- Haruki Murakami, South of the Border, West of the Sun

### Weird list Bug

In security, you ususally think about this kind of thing in terms of the 'attack surface'. Software systems can be thought of as a series of fuzzy boundaries. As an attacker in the web, we should enumerate the ways we can affect the AppleID dialog code:


1. We can try to send the victim to a special URL on `icloud.com` and hope that it affects the login dialog. If the `redirect_uri` is derived from the location, we might be able to add extra stuff to the url that might be misinterpreted.

2. We can try to embed the AppleID login dialog, but doing so requires:

    1. Bypassing the `frame-ancestors` directive somehow (`redirect_uri` injection?)

    2. Some other sink on the embed frame itself. TBD.

3. We could try attacking the the `postMessage` mechanism the embed uses to communicate with its parent. If it doesn't sufficiently verify the communication to its parent, we could impersonate it and affect its internal state.
